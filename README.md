# Anakin Challenge
This repository contains code that responds to the first test of the technical interview for Software Engineer at [Anakin](https://www.workatastartup.com/companies/anakin/website)

## Background

> Go to https://food.grab.com/ph/en/ and enter any place in Manila. The website will display a number of restaurants around the given location Scroll down and click "Load More" when you see one. There would need to be clicked many such "Load More" buttons if you want to see all the restaurants
> For this assignment, you have to fetch and give the latitudes and longitudes of all the restaurants on this page.
> Grab is the Swiggy of Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines etc. To access it on your browser, you would have to use a VPN or a proxy. Hope that helps.

> As you will notice, latitudes and longitudes are not available on the page -- but there is a way to get them from the same page - without using any third-party service such as maps opening each restaurant separately etc. The assignment is to find a way to get the data from the same page and code it - only the third part.

> Do note that we need the latitudes and latitudes of ALL restaurants - which should be more than a hundred on one page (in a city like Manila, Philippines).
